% White Space
Since white space bands were free for wireless communication, many efforts have been 
put in the area for the application of white space bands.~\cite{fccwhitespace} 
In~\cite{bahl2009white}. the author considered a cognitive method to avoid collision 
between white space communication and TV broadcasting. 
Many works increasing the convenience of using white space databases have been published 
(e.g., Microsoft's White Space Database~\cite{msdatabase}).
Google has even visualized the licensed white space channels 
in US cities with an API for research and commercial use~\cite{googledatabase}.
Previous work discussed the point to point communication with white space bands~\cite{cui2013leveraging}, 
and the wireless network deployment with plenty white space channels~\cite{pcuiwinmee}.
However, many of the major cities in the US do not have plenty white space channels, such as 
most area of Austin, TX has only one white space channel. As far as we know, there is no work 
discuss these scenarios.


%  Multi-channel
Applying white space in wireless network is similar to the previous multi-channel works other the 
propagation variation. In~\cite{bodas2012low} a multi-channel system is formulated as a queuing 
system and Server Side Greedy algorithm is proposed to optimize the throughput with low complexity. 
In~\cite{ji2013performance}, Delay-based Queue-Side-Greedy algorithm is proposed with low complexity 
for optimal throughput and near-optimal delay.~\cite{liu2014energy} develop a multi-objective optimization 
framework to minimal energy consumption in a multi-channel multi-radio system. 
However, these works do not address minimizing the resource for certain quality of service and assume an 
on-off channel model.

% On-off channel
Previous works in real time systems put many efforts to minimize the resources, such as processors~\cite{nelissen2012techniques}.
In~\cite{li2014analysis}, the author proves the capacity augmentation bounds for schedulers of parallel tasks. 
However, these works assume the parallel tasks have uniform servers. 
Previous work~\cite{chen2011feasibility} investivate the white space in a queuing system without considering the 
hetergeneous topology.
In contrast, we study the performance of a hetergeneous network with both white space channels 
and WiFi channels in channel utilization.
