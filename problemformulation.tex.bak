% Background and problem model
\subsection{Model and Assumptions}
\label{subsec:model}

% Background
% Multiband variation
Wireless propagation refers to the signal loss characteristics when wireless signals 
are transmitted through the wireless medium. The strength of the received signal depends on 
both the line-of-sight path (or lack thereof) and multiple other paths that result from reflection, 
diffraction, and scattering from obstacles~\cite{andersen1995propagation}. The widely-used Friis
equation characterizes the received signal power $P_r$ in terms of transmit power $P_t$, transmitter 
gain $G_t$, receiver gain $G_r$, wavelength $\lambda$ of the carrier frequency, distance $R$ from 
transmitter to receiver, and path loss exponent $n$ according to~\cite{friis}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:friis}
P_r=P_t+G_t+G_r+10n \log_{10}\left( \frac{\lambda}{4\pi R}\right)
\end{equation}
Here, $n$ varies according to the aforementioned environmental 
factors with a value ranging from two to five in typical outdoor 
settings~\cite{rappaport}.
% Tell the propagation of white space is much larger than wifi
Thus, the channels of white space bands propagates further than the channels of the WiFi bands in 
free space under the same RSSI threshold, transceiver settings~\ref{eq:friis}. 
% White spcae is good out resource to improve the service of Wifi cell
The propagation range of white space channels could be many times of WiFi channels, for instance, 
450 MHz channels has more than 12 times propagation range as 5 GHz channels. The larger propagation 
of white space channels make it possible to assist a WiFi mesh with few white space channels.

% Give the model and assumption
% B channel; N user; M AP;
Given a WiFi mesh wireless system with $M$ access points and $N$ users as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:systemmodel}. 
The users are scheduled with the access point on the single channel $f \in F_M$ located in its own mesh. We consider $F_w$ 
new white space radios is installed on one of the access points to assistant the existing WiFi network. The 
capacity of each radio $C$ is a equally restrict number of all the channels. For each user, it has $1+F_w$ 
channels to be scheduled, the previous WiFi channels and the new white space channels. 
Then the $N$ users has the options to schedule either WiFi or the new white space channels. 
The channel capacity of the scheduled channels between the access points and users is 
noted as a matrix in Eq.~\ref{eq:usercapacity}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:usercapacity}
H_{i,j}^f(t)= G(\lambda,t),i \in M, j\in N, f \in (F_M+F_w) 
\end{equation} 
$\lambda$ represents the in-field measured historical data and dynamic sensing information.
We use a context-aware method to estimate the $j$ user capacity $H_{i,j}^f(t)$ to an access point 
$i$ on channel $f$. We assume the users from the same mesh cell are in a single interference 
domain, so these users have to apply a time division for the WiFi channel assigned for this cell. 
Only one user of the system could occupy a single channel during a time slot. Considering the 
limited number of white space channels in dense area and the fact spatial reuse of white space 
will make the problem considerably more challenging, we will remains an interesting direction 
of future research. 
% Enough channel resource given
We assume there are enough channel resource given for the system according to worst channel capacity 
state $H_{i,j}^{f*}(t)$.


% Buffer and tolerance time
In a time slot, we assume the unscheduled radios remain in sleep mode to save energy. 
Also we ignore the sleeping energy as well as the amount of energy spent on channel/radio 
switching. An operating radio will cost equal power during a time unit. 
In ~\cite{niida2010user}, a user has a certain patience for waiting. 
The tolerance time varies across the traffic type, such as text information, 
voice information. We noted as tolerance time as $\mu$. To simply the problem, 
we assume an arbitrary average value for $\mu$ for the users in the area. 
The user experience will be worse if the waiting time longer than $\mu$.
Another assumption is each user has $B$ buffer store the traffic demand. 
The buffer is a FIFO system.
 


% Here D is preknow in T slots and discuss the T constraints
In this system, the channel capacity $H_{i,j}^f(t)$ is from the SNR according to 
Friis model and in-field measurements. We consider discrete time with a suitably 
chosen small time unit. %One user can only associate 
%with a single channel during a time slot to avoid heavy interference. 
Users scheduled with the same channel will share the time unit through time division inside 
the time slot. We assume the channel capacity is flat during a time slot. 
We assume the switching time is negligible. The traffic demand arrive at a user as a 
Poisson process, with the vector noted as $\bm{D(t)} = [D_1(t),D_2(t),...D_N(t)]$ and the 
sum rate $D(t) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N D_i(t)$.  The rate $D(t)$ is the aggregate rate of data 
generated from all users. 
We assume the user traffic during the tolerance time $\mu$ are pre-known.
And the last time slot of $\mu$ has no traffic of users.
%The served traffic flow $\Gamma$ represents the traffic  
%delivered to the access points through the wireless channels.


%As discussed in ~\cite{niida2010user}, the tolerance 
%time of traffic varies from text information, voice information. To address the user tolerance time, we 
%have the waiting time constraint $\mu_j,j\in N$ based on the users traffic demand types.  
% Buffer assumptions
%Through this waiting time constraint, the waiting time of a user is limited in a certain time window, 
%which means the traffic of a user will be served during the tolerance time to satisfy the QoS requirements.
%We define the payoff function according to the waiting time of user's traffic and traffic types in Eq.\ref{eq:payoff}. 
%To address the user tolerance time, we build the payoff functions based on the users traffic demand and the buffered time of the 
%traffic demand to process the channel schedule. Through this payoff function, the waiting time of a user is limited in 
%a certain time window, which means a user will be served at least once to satisfy the QoS requirements.
%We define the payoff function according to the waiting time of user's traffic and traffic types in Eq.\ref{eq:payoff}. 
%
%% Payoff B, benefit
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:payoff}
%\xi=\sum \alpha^{t_d}\cdot T
%\end{equation}
%%$\alpha$ is a parameter represents the traffic types. 
%To represents the variation, we define the $\alpha \ge 1$ to represent the tolerance of traffic
%type to make an individual user stay in the tolerance time. 
%$t_d$ is the time the user has waited for the traffic in the queue. Through the definition, the traffic could be 
%scheduled according to the traffic type and the waiting time. 
%According the the payoff function, the expected benefit of a served beam schedule could be calculated through the BBS framework.
%With BBS, the time efficient for the system is increased and the satisfaction of users and power efficient.




\subsection{Problem Formulation}
\label{subsec:problem}


We formulate the system discussed in~\ref{subsec:model} as a discrete-time queuing system as shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:flowconfig}. The channels are represented as a servers in the queuing system.
Table.~\ref{tab:notation} summarizes the notation used in this work.
The queuing system has $N$ queues and $F_M+F_w$ servers connecting by time-varying channels $H^*(N,F_M+F_w)$.


\input{notation}




\begin{figure}
\vspace{-0.0in}

\includegraphics[width=84mm]{figures/flowconfig}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\caption{System Model}
\label{fig:flowconfig}
\vspace{-0.1in}
\end{figure}


In this system, during a time unit, the users need to schedule with their achieved channels. 
Let matrix \{$A_{i,j}(t),i\in (F_M+F_w), j\in N$\} denote a schedule meets the performance constraints 
will be discussed later.
%where $A_{i,j}^b = 1$ denotes user $j$ is scheduled with access point $i$ on channel $b$.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:associate_def}
 A_{i,j}(t) = \left\{ 
	  \begin{array}{l l}
	    1   &  if\ D_{j\in N},\ is\ scheduled\ with\ \\
		& channel\ j \in (F_M+F_w) \\
		0 &  Otherwise
			    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}



%We assume one user can only associate with a single access point on a single channel in Eq.~\ref{eq:associate}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{eq:associate}
%\sum\limits_{i=1}^{M+B} A_{i,j} \le 1
%\end{equation}
%We now analyze the traffic with the objective of maximizing the served traffic flow over the channel 
%association.

% Traffic served
With a schedule $A$, the served traffic flow of a user is the minimize value of the queue with 
enough channel capacity, or the remaining capacity. The condition $\psi$ as shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:sfcondition}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sfcondition}
		\psi =  \sum\limits_{j=1}^N \gamma_j(t) \cdot A_{i,j}(t) 
		%when \ \sum\limits_{j=1}^N \gamma_j(t) \cdot A_{i,j}(t) > C
		%	    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

The served traffic flow is represented as in Eq.~\ref{eq:effectiverate}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:effectiverate}
 \gamma_j(t) = \left\{ 
	  \begin{array}{l l}
	     \min\limits_{j\in N}(Q_j(t),\sum\limits_{i=1}^{F_M+F_w} A_{i,j}(t) \cdot H_{i,j}(t)) & \psi \le C    \\ 
		 0 & \psi > C
			    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}



% The length of the queue
The new arrival traffic demand $D_i(t)$ can not be served at the current time slot $t$.
The individual queues $Q_j(t),j\in N$ at the end of the time slot $t$ is represented as Eq.~\ref{eq:userqueue}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:userqueue}
%Q_j(t) = Q_j(t-1)+D_j(t)-\min{\{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{(F_m+F_w)} H_{i,j}(t)\cdot A_{i,j}(t),Q_j(t-1)}\}
Q_j(t) = Q_j(t-1)+D_j(t)- \gamma_j(t)
\end{equation}


% Buffer constraint
In the system, the queue must be able to store in the buffer of user as in Eq.~\ref{eq:bufferconstraint} 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bufferconstraint}
%\sum\limits_{t^*}^{t^*+\mu_j}\gamma_j(t^*) \ge Q(t^*)+D(t^*), j\in N
Q_j(t) \le B
\end{equation}
$B$ is the buffer size of a user.

% Radio representation
The operated radios $R_i$ in the system is chosen from the WiFi radios $F_M$ and the white space radios $F_w$. 
If the a radio $R_i$ is chosen, $R_i = 1$, otherwise $R_i = 0$, as shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:radio}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:radio}
 R_i(t) = \left\{ 
	  \begin{array}{l l}
	    1   &  \sum\limits_{j=1}^N A_{i,j}(t) \ge 1\\
		0 &  Otherwise
			    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

During the $\mu$ time slot, the system have to transfer all the data coming to and in 
the buffer. During the $\mu$ time slot, to minimize the power consumption is 
important for the carriers.
The goal is represented as shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:objective}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:objective}
R^*(t) = \min{\{\sum\limits_{t=0}^{\mu}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{(F_M+F_w)} R_{i}}(t)\}
%\xi = \min{\{\sum\limits_{t}^{t+T}\sum\limits_{i}^{(F_M+F_w)} R_{i}}(t)\}
\end{equation}
$R^*$ represent the minimum operating radios power during $\mu$ time slots required to satisfy the 
users in the system. 

% Discuss the feasibility of buffer
When the total traffic demand of the users are small, one radio in white space could achieve the 
requirements of the users. However, as the total traffic demand increase with the number of users 
or the demand per user, we need to the find the feasibility of the system first. 
The minimize number of operating radios has to fufill the maximize capacity of each user greater than 
the remaining buffer and the new caming data as shwon in Eq.~\ref{eq:capacity}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:capacity}
\sum\limits_{j=1}^{F_m+F_b}H_{ij}(T)\ge Q_i(T) ,\ i\in N
\end{equation}
Otherwise the buffer will be overflow, and there is no feasible solution of the system.

Instead of an On-off channel, we apply a measurement based channel state estimation $H_{i,j}^f(t)$ 
in the system. The system is designed based on the worst channel state $H_{i,j}^{f*}(t)$ having enough 
resource for scheduling. Thus, the question is when the channel state $H_{i,j}^f$ is better, how many 
channel resource we can reduce from the system for current time slot $t$.

% Reduce the radio/server/channel resource



% New section feasibility, and Max flow formulation

%The model could be formulated as a {\it Max-Flow} problem~\cite{networkoptimization}. The question is 
%looking for a feasible flow $\Gamma$ under the constraints of channel capacity $H$ and traffic demand $D$. 
%The lower bound of flow is $0$, the upper bound of a single flow from the accss point $i$ to user $j$ is 
%the measurements based $H_{i,j}^b$.
%Thus, $\gamma_j \le \sum\limits_{i\in M} \sum\limits_{b \in B} H_{i,j}^b\cdot A_{i,j}^b$. The max-flow model 
%of the problem is feasible.
